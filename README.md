Contains the original spreadsheet that the Revolut's community created back when Revolut had a public forum. The file was last updated on 17/01/2020 and you can still find the original Dropbox link shared on the forum, here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kh7x28lca0vep8wuyt5xa/Revolut_FreeATM.xlsx?rlkey=0g9o90epsmw2b9jthfqmp1w28&e=3&dl=0

Since the file has not been updated since, and it is still super useful for me when I travel, I created a tool using the original data from the spreadsheet, with the goal to keep the idea alive, where you can check each country's ATM fees when you want to withdraw cash.

Please help me keep it up-to-date, by suggesting changes or add new ATM fees by creating an issue or a PR.
